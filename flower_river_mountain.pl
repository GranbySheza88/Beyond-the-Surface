The program will include several components, including: 

1. Art therapy activities: This program will provide a variety of art activities that focus on using art as a form of self-expression and healing. Activities such as drawing, painting, sculpture, and other art mediums will be used to explore emotions and sensations tied to trauma.

2. Support groups: The program will offer regular support groups, where survivors can share their experiences and receive support from others in a safe environment.

3. Online resources: We will provide online resources to survivors to help them connect with other survivors and learn more about art therapy. 

4. Individual counseling: The program will provide individual counseling for survivors, allowing them to process their experiences in a safe and supportive setting. 

5. Referrals: We will provide referrals to other services and resources that can provide additional help and support.

This program is an important step in providing trauma survivors with the tools they need to heal and grow. We hope that this program will provide survivors with the opportunity to express themselves, build resilience, and connect with a supportive community.
